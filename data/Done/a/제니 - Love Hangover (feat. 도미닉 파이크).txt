[Intro]
Am  F  C  G

[Verse 1]
Am                 F
Fight me fight me fight me
C                  G
You made me so unlike me
Am                 F
I don't wanna talk come behind me
C                  G
Know you ain't the one but you might be
Am  F  C  G
Who sent you Who sent you Who sent you Who sent you 'round again

[Chorus]
Am                 F
We say it's over
C                  G
But I keep fu**ing with you
Am                 F
And every time I do
C                  G
I wake up with this love hangover
Am                 F
You got me pouring for two
C                  G
I swore I'd never do it again
