[Verse 1]
C                 F              C                     F
I don't know you, but I want you all the more for that
C                         F               C                 F
Words fall through me and always fool me, and I can't react
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
    Am7         G      Fsus2   G                 Am7        Gadd9           F
And games that never amount to more than they're meant will play themselves out
 
 
[Chorus]
C                 Fsus2             Am7                   Fsus2
Take this sinking boat and point it home, we've still got time
C                  Fsus2             Am7                    Fsus2
Raise your hopeful voice, you have a choice, you'll make it now
 
 
[Verse 2]
C               Fsus2              C                   Fsus2
Falling slowly, eyes that know me, and I can't go back
    C                  Fsus2         C                     Fsus2
And moods that take me and erase me, and I'm painted black
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
      Am       Em/G      Fsus2     G               Am         Em/G          Fadd9
Well, you have suffered enough and warred with yourself, it's time that you won
 
 
[Chorus]
C                 Fsus2             Am7                    Fsus2
Take this sinking boat and point it home, we've still got time
C                  Fsus2             Am7                     Fsus2
Raise your hopeful voice, you have a choice, you've made it now
C               Fsus2         Am7               Fsus2
Falling slowly, sing your melody, I'll sing it loud
