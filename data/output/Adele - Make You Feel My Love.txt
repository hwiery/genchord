[Intro]
|G    | D   | F   | C   |
|Cm   | G   |A7 D7| G   |
 
 
[Verse 1]
G                          D
  When the rain is blowing in your face
F                        C
  And the whole world is on your case
Cm                    G
  I could offer you a warm embrace
A7            D7           G
  To make you feel my love
 
 
[Verse 2]
G                              D
  When evening shadows and the stars appear
F                              C
  And there is no one there to dry your tears
Cm                       G
  I could hold you for a million years
A7            D7          G
  To make you feel my love
 
 
[Bridge 1]
C                              G
  I know you haven't made your mind up yet
B7            C              G
  But I would never do you wrong
C                               G
  I've known it from the moment that we met
A7                              D
No doubt in my mind where you belong
 
 
[Verse 3]
G                       D
  I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
F                            C
  I'd go crawling down the avenue
Cm                            G
  No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
A7            D7          G
  To make you feel my love

[Bridge 2]
C                              G
  The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
B7           C            G
  And on the highway of regret
C                                 G
  The winds of change are blowing wild and free
Am7                            D7
You ain't seen nothing like me yet
 
 
[Outro]
G                                 D
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
F                   C
  Nothing that I wouldn't do
Cm                      G
  Go to the ends of the earth for you
A7            D7          G
  To make you feel my love
A7            D7          G
  To make you feel my love
