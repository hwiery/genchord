[Intro]
Dm G Am Am
 
[Verse 1]
                Dm       G    Am
Ohhhhh, angels sent from up above
              Dm        G        Am
You know you make my world light up
                Dm
When I was down
     G       Am
When I was hurt
             Dm      Am
You came to lift me up...
            Dm         G        Am
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
           Dm             G     Am
Oh now I think I must be miles up
          Dm    G         Am
When I was a river, dried up
             Dm       Am
You came to rain a flood
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
              Am        G    Am
So drink from me, drink from me
           F  Em   Dm
When I was so thirsty
          Am G  Am
Pour on a symphony
      Dm
Now I just can't get enough
                  Am        G  Am
Put your wings on me, wings on me
           F  Em Dm
When I was so heavy
          Am G  Am
Pour on a symphony
         Dm
When I'm low, low, low, low
 
[Chorus]
 F    G   Am
I-Oh-ah-oh-ah
                           F
Got me feeling drunk and high
     G       Am
So high, so high 
 F    G   Am
I-oh-ah-oh-ah
                        F
I'm feeling drunk and high
     G        Am
So high, so high

[Verse 2]
                Dm       G    Am
Ohhhhh, angels sent from up above
              Dm        G        Am
I feel you coursing through my blood
            Dm         G        Am
Life is a drink, your love's about
                Dm        Am
To make the stars come out
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
                  Am        G  Am
Put your wings on me, wings on me
           F  Em Dm
When I was so heavy
          Am G  Am
Pour on a symphony
         Dm
When I'm low, low, low, low
 
[Chorus]
 F    G   Am
I-Oh-ah-oh-ah
                               F
You got me feeling drunk and high
     G       Am
So high, so high
 F    G   Am
I-oh-ah-oh-ah
                        F
I'm feeling drunk and high
     G        Am
So high, so high
 F    Dm   Am
I-oh-ah-oh-ah
              F         G       Am
la-la-la-la-la-la high so high so high
 F    G   Am
I-oh-ah-oh-ah
                        F
I'm feeling drunk and high
     G        Am
So high, so high

                                F G Am

Then we'll shoot across the...

Then we'll shoot across the sky
