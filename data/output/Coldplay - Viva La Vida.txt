[Intro]
C   D   G   Em   x2
 
 
[Verse 1]
          C        D
I used to rule the world
           G                    Em
Seas would rise when I gave the word
                     C      D
Now in the morning I sleep alone
          G                 Em
Sweep the streets I used to own
 
 
[Interlude]
C   D   G   Em   x2
 
 
[Verse 2]
          C        D
I used to roll the dice
         G                  Em
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
              C           D
Listen as the crowd would sing:
         G                      Em
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
             C        D
One minute I held the key
         G                    Em
Next the walls were closed on me
                         C       D
And I discovered that my castles stand
     G                       Em
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
 
 
[Chorus]
  C              D
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
G             Em
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
C                D
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
   G                 Em
My missionaries in a foreign field
C                 D
For some reason I can't explain
G                         Em              C      D
Once you'd gone there was never, never an honest word
         Bm               Em
That was when I ruled the world
 
 
[Interlude]
C   D   G   Em   x2
 
 
[Verse 3]
                      C    D
It was the wicked and wild wind
              G               Em
Blew down the doors to let me in
                          C        D
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
       G                     Em
People couldn't believe what I'd become
         C      D
Revolutionaries wait
       G                Em
For my head on a silver plate
                   C      D
Just a puppet on a lonely string
    G                         Em
Oh, who would ever want to be king?
 
 
[Chorus]
  C              D
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
G             Em
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
C                D
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
   G                 Em
My missionaries in a foreign field
C                 D
For some reason I can't explain
  G                      Em
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
         C      D
Never an honest word
             Bm               Em
But that was when I ruled the world
 
 
[Interlude]
C   Em   x3
D   D
 
  C   D    G   Em
Ohhhhhh  Ohhhhhhh
  C   D    G   Em
Ohhhhhh  Ohhhhhhh
 
 
[Chorus]
  C              D
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
G             Em
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
C                D
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
   G                 Em
My missionaries in a foreign field
C                 D
For some reason I can't explain
  G                      Em
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
         C      D
Never an honest word
             Bm               Em
But that was when I ruled the world
