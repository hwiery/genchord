[Verse 1]
        Am         F
Oh they say people come
     C          Em7
They say people go
        Am      F           C        G
this particular diamond was extra special
           Am           F
And though you might be gone
        C             Em7
And the world may not know
        Am        F       G
Still I see you celestial
 
[Instrumental]
Am F C G
Am F C G
 
       Am       F
Like a lion you ran
  C           Em7
a goddess you rolled
        Am        F
Like an eagle you circled
   C          G
in perfect purple
       Am               F
So how come things move on?
    C               Em7
How come cars don’t slow?
        Am             F         G
When it feels like the end of my world
       Am           F             G
When I should but I can’t let you go
 
[Chorus 1]
             Am  F C  Em7
But when I’m cold, cold
         Am  F C  G
When I’m cold, cold
          Am             F
There’s a light that you give me
     C         Em7
When I’m in shadow
          Am          F           G
There’s a feeling you give me, an everglow

[Verse 2]
     Am          F
Like brothers in blood
C           Em7
sisters who ride
       Am            F
And we swore on that night
        C               G
We’d be friends ‘til we die
        Am          F
But the changing of winds
        C          Em7
And the way waters flow
        Am           F          G
Life is short as the falling of snow
        Am        F           G
And now I’m gonna miss you, I know
 
[Chorus 2]
         Am  F C  Em7
When I’m cold, cold
         Am  F   C  G
In water rolled, salt
            Am            F
I know that you’re always with me
        C            Em7              Am          F       G
And the way you will show, and you’re with me wherever I go
        Am           F             G
and you give me this feeling, this everglow
 
[Bridge]
Am F C Em7
Am F C G
Am F C Em7
 
oh- IIII
                Am              F         G
what I wouldn’t give for just a moment to hold
        Am            F             G
Yeah, I live for this feeling, this everglow
 
[Outro]
Am F C Em7
Am F C G
 
      Am           F              C         Em7
So if you love someone, you should let them know
        Am             F              G
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow
