[Verse]
 
C               Fmaj7
So this is how the story went
Am              G
I met someone by accident
F               C
who blew me away
Am              G
who blew me away
 
       C                 Em
It was in the darkest of my days
         Am                     G
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
    F              C
And buried them away
Am             G
Buried them away
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Dm                      G
And I wish I could lay down beside you
C                       Am
When the day is done
Dm                      G            Am  Asus2 Am
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
Dm                      G
But like everything I've ever known
C                       Am
you'll disappear one day
Dm                              G              C  Fmaj7   C Fmaj7
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
C               Fmaj7
I dropped you off at the train station
Am              G
And put a kiss on top of your head
F               C
I watched you wave
Am              G
I watched you wave
 
C                       Em
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
Am                      G
Neon lights and waiting papers
F                       C
That I call home
Am                      G
I call that home
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Dm                      G
And I wish I could lay down beside you
C                       Am
When the day is done
Dm                      G            Am  Asus2 Am
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
Dm                      G
But like everything I've ever known
C                       Am
you'll disappear one day
Dm                              G              C  Fmaj7   C Fmaj7
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
C               Fmaj7
I woke up feeling heavy hearted
Am              G
I'm going back to where I started
F               C
The morning rain
Am              G
The morning rain
 
C                       Em
And you know I wish that you were here
Am                      G
But that same old road that brought me here
F                       C
Is calling me home
Am                      G
Is calling me home
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Dm                      G
And I wish I could lay down beside you
C                       Am
When the day is done
Dm                      G            Am  Asus2 Am
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
Dm                      G
But like everything I've ever known
C                       Am
You'll disappear someday
Dm                              G              C
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
Dm                              G              C*   C
And I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away
