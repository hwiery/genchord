[Verse]
 
         C
Call it magic
G/B      D
Call it true
G/B        C
I call it magic,
G/B           D
When I'm with you
G/B             C
And I just got broken
G/B          D
Broken into two
G/B              C
Still I call it magic,
G/B               D           G/B <-(one stroke)
When I'm next to you
 
 
[Chorus]
 
       C
And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't
     G/B
No I don't, it's true
   D
I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't
             G/B
Want anybody else but you
   C
I don't, No I don't, No I don't, No I don't
     G/B
No I don't, it's true
   D
I don't, No I don't, No I don't, No I don't
             G/B
Want anybody else but you

[Verse]
 
         C
Call it magic
G/B         D
Cut me into two
G/B                C
And with all your magic,
G/B               D
I disappear from view
G/B              C
And I can't get over, 
G/B             D
Can't get over you
G/B               C
Still, I call it magic
G/B              D            G/B
Such a precious truth
 
 
[Chorus]
 
       C
And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't
     G/B
No I don't, it's true
   D
I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't
             G/B
Want anybody else but you
   C
I don't, No I don't, No I don't, No I don't
     G/B
No I don't, it's true
   D
I don't, No I don't, No I don't, No I don't
             G/B
Want anybody else but you
 
 
[Bridge]
 
       C        G/B    D
Wanna fall, I fall so far
         C     G/B     D
I wanna fall, fall so hard
  G/B      C
I call it magic
       G/B     D
And I call it true
G/B       C     G/B  D
Call it maaaaaa-aaa-gic
 
   G/B   C      G/B   D
Oououh       Oououh       
   G/B   C      G/B   D
Oououh       Oououh      
 
 
[Verse]
 
           G/B      C
And if you were to ask me
                G/B         D
After all that we've been through
        G/B        C
"Still believe in magic?"
      G/B    D
Well yes, I do
   G/B     C
Oh yes, I do
G/B    D
Yes, I do
   G/B    C
Oh yes, I do
   G/B      D
Of course I do
