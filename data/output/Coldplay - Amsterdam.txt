capo 1st fret

[Verse]
D        A        E           G
Come on, oh my star is fading
D       A         E         G
And I swerve out of control
D   A     E              G
If I, if I'd only waited
D        A         E               G
I'd not be stuck here in this hole.

[Verse]
D        A        E           G
Come here, oh my star is fading
D       A         E         G
And I swerve out of control
D   A     E              G
And I swear I waited and waited
D        A         E               G
I've got to get out of this hole.
[Chorus]
E                    G
But time is on your side
              D        A
It's on your side now
E7                        G
Not pushing you down and all around
          D         A
It's no cause for concern
*intro again*
[Verse]
D        A        E           G
Come on, oh my star is fading
D       A         E         G
And I see no chance of release
D   A     E              G
And I know I'm dead on the surface
D        A         E               G
But I am screaming underneath.
[Chorus]
E                    G
But time is on your side
              D        A
It's on your side now
E7                        G
Not pushing you down and all around
          D         A
No it's no cause for concern
E                    G
Stuck on the end of this ball and chain
              D        A
And I'm on my way back down again
E7                        G
Stood on a bridge, tied to the noose
          D         A
Sick to the stomach
E
You can say what you mean
                      G
But it won't change a thing
           D         A
I'm sick of the secrets
          E7         G
Stood on the edge, tied to the noose
          D                   A     E7 G
You came along and you cut me loose
          D                   A     E7 G
You came along and you cut me loose
          D                   A     E7 G
You came along and you cut me loose
D A E G
